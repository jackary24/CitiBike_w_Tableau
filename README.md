# CitiBike Crusin’

## Overview of the Project
After observing the success of a Bikesharing company named Citibike in New York City, we were tasked with further analysis of ride
data, in order to see if the same concept would be feasible in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Throughout the module we utilized 
Tableau in order to assess the composition of ridership, the average length of rentals, as well as the starting and stopping 
locations of the bikes themselves. Finally we gathered our observations together in a story format for presentation to a potential
investor, to see if they would be interested in helping us get our own version of CitiBike up and running in Iowa. 

The presentation was uploaded to Tableau Public. Please follow along using the provided Link

## Analysis

The analysis of the CitiBike Data fell into one of three categories: ridership composition, peak riding times, and location of rides.

### Who Rides CitiBikes?
In the first slide of the Tableau story we can see two charts. The total duration of rides broken down by gender, and the
frequency of rides broken down by birth year. From these two charts we can draw the conclusion that Riders generally prefer
shorter trips, between 0 to 15 minutes, with a general spike around the 5 minute mark. Self-reported Males also generally use the
product more than Females, with Unknown Riders remaining relatively consistent between the 5 and 30 minute mark. Additionally the
majority of Riders are born between 1980 to 1995, with the bulk of those riders being active subscribers to Citibike. In the
expansion into Iowa, it would be important to look at the composition of the population by age, as well as the density of the
city, making sure Riders can get to where they need to go in the given timeframe. 

### When do Customers Ride?
In the next slide we looked further at the composition of Riders, as well as times that they preferred to ride. Riders classified
as “Unknown” seemed to subscribe less to Citibike, with the majority of rides taking place on weekends. Riders who reported
themselves as “Male” or “Female” held a higher rate of subscription to the service and generally chose to ride during the work
week, with the two most popular days being Thursday and Friday. Peak times for these two class of riders were divided into
mornings (7 am to 9am) and afternoons (5 pm to 7 pm). One item to note is that ridership for “Females” fell more sharply in the
evenings then it did for their “Male” counterparts. One thing we may consider if the project is brought to Des Moines is to place
central hubs in visible, well lit locations for increased rider safety. 

### Where Do Riders Come From? And Where Do They End Up?
On the last slide we can also see a few heatmaps of NYC showing the start locations as well as the ending locations for CitiBike
rentals. By far the most popular borough of New York is in Manhattan. This makes sense as it contains many businesses, as well as
national landmarks that people may be interested in seeing. CitiBikes may offer locals, as well as tourists a popular alternative
to driving in the busy streets of Manhattan. 

## Further Analysis

For further research, we may consider looking at the distance between starting locations and ending locations for rides. If more
bikes are coming into Manhattan than are going out, we may need to deploy teams to relocate away from one central hub (say the 
Times Square) into other parts of the city to ensure subscribers can get a bike when needed, and continue their subscription. 
Additionally with low temperatures being prevalent in bothe Iowas and New York, I would recommend looking at rates of ridership 
during the colder months, as well as the strain that weather puts on the bikes themselves. Finally I would also consider the 
layout of Des Moines, as well as the “bikeability” to ensure that CitiBikes are a viable alternative to driving.
